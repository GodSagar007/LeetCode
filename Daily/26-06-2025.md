##-✅ Solved: 
	[Number Of Islands] : Used a DFS based approach . Not a medium level in my opinion case the logic is straight forward. Space complexity can be improved with a BFS approach i guess.
##-✅ Solved: 
	[Reorganize String] : Used common sense for spacing people in general like high school permutation problem. Did better than the ChatGPt suggest solution (NlogK) whereas mine(N) *insert smilie face*
