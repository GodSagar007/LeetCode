##-âœ… Solved: 
	[Remove K Digits] : Used a Stack approach . Stumbled a bit on 2 edge cases one being the leading zeroes and other being maybe result is empty as we Have to remove k digits. It was a nice question. 
##-âœ… Solved: 
	[Trapping Rain Water] : Used a 2 pointer approach. Rather than calculating min left and right height bigger than the current we can just go with the boundary of left and right and subtract with that. Had a doubt of missing heights between boundary and current but when thought a bit more I understood we only want water on top of the current ww.r.t to lower boundary between left and right. deserving hard level question
