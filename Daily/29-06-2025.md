##-âœ… Solved: 
	[Groups Anagrams] : Used a dictionary approach to store the words with base word as key. At first I sorted each word but then thought of a better approach of counting each character counts of that word as ordering doesn't matter as the question states they are anagrams only character frequency matters.
##-âœ… Solved: 
	[Rotting Oranges] : Used a BFS approach. Implementing really clarified BFS for me in such problems like even though we are looping it doesn't mean time is passing only after loop ends does the time pass.
##-âœ… Solved: 
	[Merge K Sorted Lists] : Created a function 2 merge 2 lists then using divide and conquer expanded it to K lists. Turns out the helper to merge 2 lists i made is actually a question in itself lol.
